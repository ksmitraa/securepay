⚛️ Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

The frontend of Secure Pay AI is built using React with Vite for fast development and hot module replacement (HMR).

Vite provides a lightweight and efficient environment to develop and run the React application with instant updates during development.

Two React plugins are supported in Vite:

@vitejs/plugin-react — uses Babel for fast refresh

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc — uses SWC for faster compilation
